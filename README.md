# Vagrant Ansible for CakePHP

Vagrant Ansible creates a Vagrant installation for CakePHP using Ansible with the following features:

- Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
- Ningx
- PHP
- Percona (MySQL Drop-in Replacement)
- Postgres
- Redis
- Memcached
- Git
- Composer
- phpMyAdmin


## Requirements

- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). Tested on 5.x
- [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html). Tested on 1.9.x
- [Vagrant hostupdater](https://github.com/cogitatio/vagrant-hostsupdater).
- [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html). Requires 2.x

## Installation

1. Run the commands below:

	```
	git clone https://github.com/FriendsOfCake/vagrant-ansible.git --recurse-submodules
	cd vagrant-ansible
	vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater
	vagrant up
	```

2. Choose the CakePHP version you want to deploy (2 or 3), defaults to 3.

3. Note that this Vagrant machine uses NFS mounts as it significantly improves the speed of the application. You may be asked for the root password while trying to setup shared mounts.

4. The setup will take some time to finish. Sit back and enjoy!

5. When the setup is done browse to `http://app.dev/` in your browser, and you should have a default CakePHP 2.x or 3.x welcome page!


## Installation for Multiple Applications

To run Vagrant Ansible for multiple applications a few configurations have to be done.

```
git clone git@github.com:FriendsOfCake/vagrant-ansible.git --recurse-submodules
cd vagrant-ansible
```

After configured, run it with:

```
vagrant up
```

### Custom Domain Name

Edit your Vagrantfile to have the following line:

```
config.hostsupdater.aliases = [
	"app.dev",
	"phpmyadmin.app.dev",
	"whatever.dev",
	"anotherapp.dev"
]
```

### Configure Synced Folders

Open `Vagrantfile` in your editor of choice.

Add a new [synced_folder](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/synced-folders/basic_usage.html) for each application, like so:

```
config.vm.synced_folder "/path/on/local", "/path/on/vagrant", :nfs => true
```

### Configure Nginx virtual hosts

Open `ansible/group_vars/development` in your editor of choise.

Add a new block for each application, name the block your new app name.

```
  mynewapp:
    - listen 80
    - server_name mynewapp.dev
    - root /vagrant/www/webroot
    - access_log /var/log/nginx/mynewapp-access.log
    - error_log /var/log/nginx/mynewapp-error.log
    - index index.php
    - location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;
      }
    - location ~ \.php$ {
        try_files $uri =404;
        include /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php7.1-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_index index.php;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
      }
```
