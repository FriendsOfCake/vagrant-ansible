# Vagrant Ansible for CakePHP

Vagrant Ansible creates a Vagrant installation for CakePHP using Ansible with the following features:

- Ubuntu 12.04 Precise Pangolin
- Ningx 1.1
- PHP 5.5
- Percona 5.5 (MySQL Drop-in Replacement)
- Postgres 9.1
- Redis 2.8
- Memcached 1.4
- Git 1.7
- Composer


## Requirements

- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). Tested on 4.3.x, but 4.2.x should also work.
- [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html). Tested on 1.4.3
- [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html). Requires at least 1.4.2 and tested on 1.4.4


## Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:FriendsOfCake/vagrant-ansible.git --recurse-submodules
cd vagrant-ansible
vagrant up
```

Note that this Vagrant machine uses NFS mounts as it significantly improves the speed of the application. You may be asked for the root password while trying to setup shared mounts.

The setup is take some time to finish. Sit back and enjoy!

When the setup is done browse to `http://192.168.13.37/` in your browser, and you should have some sort of `It works!` page!


### Custom Domain Name

Edit your /etc/hosts file to have the following line:

```
192.168.13.37 www.app.dev app.dev
```

Note that www.app.dev will actually redirect to app.dev


### Setup the Application

Anything in `app/webroot/index.php` will be served up, and all other `index.php` files ignored.

Below you can choose between two methods to create a new application.

First lets log in to the server and find the shared /vagrant directory:

```
vagrant ssh
cd /vagrant
```


#### Create new application with [cakephp/app](https://github.com/cakephp/app) for CakePHP 3.0.x:

```
composer -sdev create-project cakephp/app app
```

Browse to `http://app.dev`, an CakePHP application should be running now!

Follow more instructions on how to configure the application at [cakephp/app](https://github.com/cakephp/app).


#### Create new application with [FriendsOfCake/app-template](https://github.com/FriendsOfCake/app-template):

```
composer -sdev create-project friendsofcake/app-template .
```

Browse to `http://app.dev`, an CakePHP application should be running now!

## Installation for Multiple Applications

To run Vagrant Ansible for multiple applications a few configurations have to be done.

```
git clone git@github.com:FriendsOfCake/vagrant-ansible.git --recurse-submodules
cd vagrant-ansible
```

After configured, run it with:

```
vagrant up
```


### Custom Domain Name

Edit your /etc/hosts file to have the following line:

```
192.168.13.37 www.$appName.dev $appName.dev www.$anotherAppName.dev $anotherAppName.dev
```


### Configure Synced Folders

Open `Vagrantfile` in your editor of choice.

Add a new [synced_folder](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/synced-folders/basic_usage.html) for each application, like so:

```
config.vm.synced_folder "/path/on/local", "/path/on/vagrant", :nfs => true
```


### Configure Nginx virtual hosts

Open `ansible/group_vars/development` in your editor of choise.

Add a new `server` block for each application, change `$appName` with your application name:

```
- server:
	file_name: $appName
	listen: 80
	server_name: $appName.dev
	root: /path/to/app/webroot
	access_log: /var/log/nginx/$appName-access.log
	error_log: /var/log/nginx/$appName-error.log
	index: index.php
	location1:
		name: /
		try_files: "$uri $uri/ /index.php?$uri&$args"
		expires: max
		access_log: "off"
	location2:
		name: "~ \\.php$"
		fastcgi_pass: "unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock"
		include: fastcgi_params

# Redirect www.$appName.dev to $appName.dev
- server:
	file_name: www.$appName
	listen: 80
	server_name: www.$appName.dev
	rewrite: "^ http://$appName.dev$uri permanent"
```
