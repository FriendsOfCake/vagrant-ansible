# Vagrant Ansible for CakePHP

Vagrant Ansible creates a Vagrant installation for CakePHP using Ansible with the following features:

- Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr (Ubuntu Server 64-bit 14.04 cloud image)
- Ningx 1.4.6
- PHP 5.5
- Percona 5.5 (MySQL Drop-in Replacement)
- Postgres 9.3
- Redis 2.8
- Memcached 1.4
- Git 1.9
- Composer
- phpMyAdmin 4.0.10


## Requirements

- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). Tested on 4.3.x, but 4.2.x should also work.
- [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html). Tested on 1.6.3
- [Vagrant hostupdater](https://github.com/cogitatio/vagrant-hostsupdater).
- [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html). Tested on 1.7 Requires at least 1.6!

## Installation

1. Run the commands below:

	```
	git clone https://github.com/FriendsOfCake/vagrant-ansible.git --recurse-submodules
	cd vagrant-ansible
	vagrant up
	```

2. Choose the CakePHP version you want to deploy (2 or 3)

3. Note that this Vagrant machine uses NFS mounts as it significantly improves the speed of the application. You may be asked for the root password while trying to setup shared mounts.

4. The setup will take some time to finish. Sit back and enjoy!

5. When the setup is done browse to `http://app.dev/` in your browser, and you should have a default CakePHP 2.x or 3.x welcome page!


## Installation for Multiple Applications

To run Vagrant Ansible for multiple applications a few configurations have to be done.

```
git clone git@github.com:FriendsOfCake/vagrant-ansible.git --recurse-submodules
cd vagrant-ansible
```

After configured, run it with:

```
vagrant up
```

### Custom Domain Name

Edit your Vagrantfile to have the following line:

```
config.hostsupdater.aliases = [
	"app.dev",
	"phpmyadmin.app.dev",
	"whatever.dev",
	"anotherapp.dev"
]
```

### Configure Synced Folders

Open `Vagrantfile` in your editor of choice.

Add a new [synced_folder](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/synced-folders/basic_usage.html) for each application, like so:

```
config.vm.synced_folder "/path/on/local", "/path/on/vagrant", :nfs => true
```

### Configure Nginx virtual hosts

Open `ansible/group_vars/development` in your editor of choise.

Add a new `server` block for each application, change `$appName` with your application name:

```
- server:
	file_name: $appName
	listen: 80
	server_name: $appName.dev
	root: /path/to/app/webroot
	access_log: /var/log/nginx/$appName-access.log
	error_log: /var/log/nginx/$appName-error.log
	index: index.php
	location1:
		name: /
		try_files: "$uri $uri/ /index.php?$uri&$args"
		expires: max
		access_log: "off"
	location2:
		name: "~ \\.php$"
		fastcgi_pass: "unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock"
		include: fastcgi_params

# Redirect www.$appName.dev to $appName.dev
- server:
	file_name: www.$appName
	listen: 80
	server_name: www.$appName.dev
	rewrite: "^ http://$appName.dev$uri permanent"
```
